<p style="font-size: xx-large;">Puppy training is crucial for developing a well-behaved and happy dog. Here are some key tips to get you started:

    Basic Training Tips:
    Start Early: Begin training as soon as you bring your puppy home. The earlier you start, the easier it is to shape their behavior.
    
    Positive Reinforcement: Use treats, praise, and play to reward good behavior. This encourages your puppy to repeat the actions you like.
    
    Consistency is Key: Use the same commands and rules consistently. This helps your puppy understand what is expected of them.
    
    Short Training Sessions: Keep sessions brief (5-10 minutes) and fun. Puppies have short attention spans, so frequent, short sessions are more effective.
    
    Socialization: Expose your puppy to different people, animals, environments, and experiences. Proper socialization helps prevent fearfulness and aggression later in life.
    
    Basic Commands: Teach essential commands such as “sit,” “stay,” “come,” “down,” and “leave it.” These commands are foundational for good behavior.
    
    Potty Training: Establish a regular feeding schedule and take your puppy outside frequently. Praise and reward them for doing their business outside.
    
    Bite Inhibition: Teach your puppy to control the strength of their bite. If they bite too hard during play, stop playing and redirect them to a toy.
    
    Leash Training: Introduce your puppy to walking on a leash gently. Reward them for walking calmly beside you.
    
    Patience and Understanding: Puppies are learning and exploring the world. Be patient and understanding as they make mistakes and learn.</p>
